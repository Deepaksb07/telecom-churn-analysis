# 📡 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis (Hybrid Python + SQL)

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of **7,043 telecom customers** to identify key indicators of churn. By implementing a hybrid workflow using **SQL for feature engineering** and **Python for visualization**, this analysis highlights high-risk segments and suggests actionable retention strategies.

**Key Goal:** Reduce customer attrition by identifying early warning signs in contract types, tenure, and payment methods.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
* **Python:** Pandas (Data Cleaning), Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
* **SQL (SQLite):** Complex Feature Engineering, Segmentation, Aggregation
* **Jupyter Notebook / Python Scripts:** Workflow Orchestration

##  Key Insights & Results
1.  **The "Early Exit" Problem:**
    * **38%** of all churned users leave within the first **3 months**.
    * *Strategic Recommendation:* Implement a "First 90 Days" onboarding campaign to increase engagement during this critical window.

2.  **Contract Vulnerability:**
    * Customers on **Month-to-Month contracts** paying via **Electronic Check** have the highest churn rate (~45%).
    * *Strategic Recommendation:* Offer incentives (e.g., small discounts or data bonuses) for users to switch to 1-year contracts or automatic bank transfers.

3.  **The "Bundle" Effect:**
    * Customers with **1 or fewer add-on services** (like Tech Support or Online Security) are **2x more likely to churn** than those with 3+ services.
    * *Strategic Recommendation:* Push "Bundle Offers" at checkout to make customers "stickier" to the ecosystem.

##  Project Structure
* `data.csv`: The raw dataset (Telco Customer Churn).
* `main.py`: The hybrid script that runs SQL queries on the data and generates charts.
* `churn_heatmap.png`: Visualization of churn risk by Contract vs. Payment Method.
* `tenure_histogram.png`: Distribution of customer tenure showing early churn spikes.

##  How to Run This Project
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/telecom-churn-analysis.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/telecom-churn-analysis.git)
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```
3.  **Run the analysis script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    *This will output the SQL query results to the console and save the visualization images to the folder.*

## 📷 Visualizations
*(Note: These images are generated by the script)*

* **Churn Heatmap:** Highlights the high-risk "Month-to-Month" segment.
* **Tenure Distribution:** Shows the massive spike in churn at Month 0-12.
